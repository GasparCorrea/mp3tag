# mp3Tag
mp3Tag is a command-line tagger for mp3 files made in Haskell.

# Origin
I decided to make this to test my beginner's knowledge in Haskell and because I was tired of dealing with complex GUI's to make minor changes in my music files.

# Description
At the moment `mp3Tag` can only make one change at a time:

`mp3Tag OPTION FILE TAG`

* **-artist** to change artist
* **-album** to change album
* **-year** to change year
* **-track** to change number of the track
* **-title** to change title of the track
